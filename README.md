# voyant

> NOTE: There are still a lot of bugs in this project, such as memory usage in some place is not will released, and about the tracepoint is a hacking

voyant is domain specific language based on the eBPF instruction set (insn) and system calls;

ulike other eBPF tools, it is designed to be lightweight and easy extendable

There are three aspectes that can account for my option;
1. First of all, no LLVM, indeed LLVM is an exceptional tool for building complier backends, but LLVM is counted in ten millionsï¼Œ the light weight is one of my goals and the rules out LLVM.
2. The second, our dsl will offer the similarly level of expressivity as general-purpose programming language, also extending the semantics in certain aspectes;


## syntax

## hello, world

```y
probe sys_enter_execve {
    printf("Hello, World!");
}
```

### variable

```y
probe sys_enter_execve {
    a = pid();
    printf("%d", a);
}
```


### bpf map

```y
probe sys_enter_execve {
    map[pid()] = 2;
    printf("%d", map[pid()]);
}
```
