**voyant is domain specific language based on the eBPF instruction set (insn) and system calls;**

ulike other eBPF tools, it is designed to be lightweight and easy extendable

There are three aspectes that can account for my option;

1. **Ligtht tool** First of all, no LLVM, indeed LLVM is an exceptional tool for building complier backends, but LLVM is counted in ten millionsï¼Œ the light weight is one of my goals and the rules out LLVM.

2. **Goal**: Because of this light weight design, our tool can be used well in resource-constrained environments

3. The third, our dsl will offer the similarly level of expressivity as general-purpose programming language, also extending the semantics in certain aspectes;


## install

```c
cd lang
make
sudo ./voyant main.y
```

## syntax

## hello, world

```y
probe sys_enter_execve {
    out("%s", "Hello, World!");
}
```

### variable

```y
probe sys_enter_execve {
    a := 1;
    out("%d\n", a);
    a = 2;
    out("%d\n", a);
}
```

### helper function

```y
probe sys_enter_open {
    out("%-18d %-16s %-6s\n", pid(), comm(), arg());
}
```

### bpf map

```y
probe sys_enter_execve {
    map[pid()] |> count();
}

probe sys_enter_execve {
    map[cpu()] |> count();
}
```

### begin
```c
BEGIN {
    out("%-18s %-16s %-6s\n", "PID", "COMM", "FILE");
}

probe sys_enter_open {
    out("%-18d %-16s %-6s\n", pid(), comm(), arg());
}
```
